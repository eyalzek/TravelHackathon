## Bitplaces Android Hello World App

1. Open this directory with Android Studio >=1.3.2.

2. Make sure to set ```customerID```, ```customerSecret``` and ```uaReleaseID``` in ```com.bitplaces.android.helloworld.MainActiviy```

3. Run the App on your phone.

4. Once the app has been initialized, it will show a Toast e.g. when entering or leaving a Bitplace (showing a Toast is of course not the intended behavior in a real application, but should demonstrate how to register and use the event handler).

This Hello World app covers only a small subset of the SDKs functionality. See the documentation and JavaDoc for more: [https://www.bitplaces.com/downloads](https://www.bitplaces.com/downloads).
